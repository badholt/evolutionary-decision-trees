     The Main program controls the command line interface, disseminating chosen
     data files to the appropriate Decision Tree algorithm. As requested and
     specified on the command line, a user will first input a number correspond-
     ing to a dataset, and then a string input corresponding to an algorithm.
     For example: "1" then "trad" runs the traditional Decision Tree algorithm
     on the Congressional Voting data.

 ^-- traditionalDecisionTree.java
     Creates a tree object of an ArrayList of ArrayLists of Nodes, as well as an
     ArrayList of testing data to be classified using the tree. The tree is
     built using an information-gain-maximizing algorithm.

2. Reflections

 The approach of function first, then optimization, appears to be working. The
 traditional decision tree started out as an impractical ArrayList of ArrayLists
 of ArrayLists etc. It was an unimplementable design. However, it allowed me to
 perfect the information gain algorithm for use as the program structure evolved.

 Time-wise, I believe I've spent approximately 15 hours on the assignment up to
 this point.  A portion of that time was spent struggling with the mathematics
 of the information gain calculation, however.  I used MatLab as an aid in
 confirming correct calculations.

 Moving forward in this project, one component I'm unsure about is the shell
 scripting.  I will need to do some more research into the desired division of
 the scripts for each tree.
